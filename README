clj -e "(compile 'dynamo-example.core)"
clj -Auberjar

Manually upload it by following these instructions.

1. Create Lambda [here](https://console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/home?region=us-east-1#/functions).
    - Call it whatever you want.
    - Set Runtime to `Java 11`.
1. On the function screen upload the file and change the handler (under "Function Code").
    - Upload the jar found in the `target` dir.
    - Handler should be `dynamo-example::main`.
1. Click "Coonfigure Test" at the top.
    - Create a new test with the following body:
        ```
        {
            "name": "hello"
        }
        ```
    - Save.
